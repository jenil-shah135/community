           		<p>The history of the Brahmin community / Brahmin Samaj in India begins with the Vedic religion of early Hinduism, also known as Sanatana Dharma, in ancient India. The Vedas are the primary source of knowledge for brahmin practices. All the sampradayas of Brahmins take inspiration from the Vedas. According to Brahmin Samaj tradition, it is believed that Vedas are apaurueya and anadi (beginning-less), but are revealed truths of eternal validity. The Vedas are considered Sruti (that which is heard, signifying the oral tradition). Traditional Brahmin accepts Vedas as apaurusheyam (not man-made), but revealed truths and of eternal validity or relevance and hence the Vedas are considered Srutis that which have been heard and are the paramount source of Brahmin traditions and is believed to be divine. These Srutis include not only the four Vedas (the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda), but also their respective Brahmanas. Brahman and Brahmin are not the same. Brahman refers to the Supreme Self or God of Hindus. Brahmin or Brahmana refers to the caste of an individual. The brahmins are scholars, teachers and priests. Additionally, the word Brahma refers to first of the gods and Brahman, the Supreme God. </p>
